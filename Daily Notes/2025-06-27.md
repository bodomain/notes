# Open a web app like an application

To integrate or open a website/webapp as an app in the **Swat window manager** (likely a typo or alternate name for **Sway**, a Wayland tiling window manager compatible with i3), you can follow these general steps using tools like `chromium`, `firefox`, or other minimalist browsers in "app mode." Here's how:

---

## 🧭 Assumptions:

If you meant **Sway**, here’s how you can open a web app as a standalone app-like window (no tabs, toolbars, etc.) and optionally assign it to a workspace or make it persistent like a native app.

---

## ✅ Method 1: Chromium/Chrome in App Mode

### 📌 Open a web app like an application:

```sh
chromium --app=https://your-webapp.com
```

### 🔁 Persistent App Launcher:

You can create a `.desktop` file or script:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
chromium --app=https://your-webapp.com
```

Save it as `~/scripts/mywebapp.sh` and make it executable:

```sh
chmod +x ~/scripts/mywebapp.sh
```

Then bind it in your Sway config (`~/.config/sway/config`):

```conf
bindsym $mod+w exec ~/scripts/mywebapp.sh
```

---

## ✅ Method 2: Firefox (Using Extensions or Kiosk Mode)

Firefox doesn’t have a native `--app` mode like Chromium, but you can use kiosk mode:

```sh
firefox --kiosk https://your-webapp.com
```

Or use [extensions like "Site Specific Browser (SSB)"](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webapp-mode/) for more integrated experiences.

## 🧩 Integration Tips

### 🎯 Assign to Workspace

In Sway config:

```conf
for_window [app_id="chromium"] move to workspace 3
```

You can get the `app_id` or `class` using:

```sh
swaymsg -t get_tree | less
```

Or use `swaymsg -t get_tree | jq` if you prefer structured JSON.

### 🌄 Autostart Web App

In `~/.config/sway/config`:

```conf
exec chromium --app=https://your-webapp.com
```

---

## ✅ Optional: Use Web App Managers

There are tools like:

- [`webapp-manager`](https://github.com/linuxmint/webapp-manager) – GUI for managing web apps
    
- [`nativefier`](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) – Turns any website into a native app (Electron-based)
    

These are heavier but good for frequent use or packaging.

## Let Me Know

- Do you indeed mean **Sway**, or is "Swat" a different WM?
    
- Would you like help creating `.desktop` launchers or assigning icons?
    

I can generate full launcher files or config snippets if needed.
