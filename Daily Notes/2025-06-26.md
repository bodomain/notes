# Troubleshooting: Non-Booting Arch Linux System (Using Live USB)


> [!TIP]
> Arch system refused to boot, recoverd it by booting from a Live USB and `chroot`ing into your existing system — **but only if you mount everything properly**.

---
## Before `arch-chroot`: Mount *All* the Things

>  **Don't skip the bind mounts — without them, chroot won’t behave like a real system.**
### Mount root and boot partitions:

```bash
mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt             # Replace with your actual root partition
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot        # If you have a separate /boot
```

### Mount virtual filesystems and device context:

```bash
mount -t proc /proc /mnt/proc
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
mount --make-rslave /mnt/sys
mount --make-rslave /mnt/dev
```

##  Quick Reference Table

| Step                                          | Result                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt`                   | Mounts your root filesystem — gives you access to files                                                                      |
| `arch-chroot /mnt`                            | Drops you into your installed Arch system’s shell                                                                            |
| *Without* `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`             | Many tools fail — kernel modules, hardware detection, bootloader repair may not work                                         |
| *With* full mounts of `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev` | `chroot` becomes a **fully functional runtime** — can load kernel modules, detect hardware, and regenerate initramfs or GRUB |

---
## Summary

* Proper mounts = stable chroot
*  Don't forget `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev` — they make the difference between a dead shell and a working repair session
* Use this setup before doing system fixes like:

  * `mkinitcpio -P`
  * `grub-install`
  * `pacman -Syu`
  * `passwd` (if needed)
